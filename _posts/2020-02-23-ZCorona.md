The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an important phenomenon threatening the well-being of all people across the world these days. The outbreak is said to have started in China but cases are being discovered in many different countries every day. You can read more about it [here](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019)!

I saw a post on social media about a hypothetical case, which I thought could be interesting for a short blog post. Suppose we already know from past cases that the mortality rate of the disease is (approximately) 2%. Also assume we are not differentiating between different age groups, pre-existing conditions, etc. The said post talked about a *hypotheitical* government that, out of fear for bigger consequences, is not 100% transparent about its discovered cases of coronavirus. However, we can be certain about the number of deaths reported by this government as being caused by the virus. Let's assume the government of this country has reported 8 deaths (we can trust this number). The government has also reported identifying 43 positive cases. **Note**: let's make two assumptions; that the 8 cases were among the 43 positive cases, and that any person contracting the virus would be easily known and identified by the government. We are ignoring any deaths as a result of the contraction and any contraction case, which are not identified by the government.

People under the social media post discussing reported numbers by this government were arguing that the number of positive cases identified by the government **has to** be larger than 43 if there were 8 deaths among them. Several users were arguing that since the mortality rate due to the contraction of the virus is 2% then the total number of people with coronavirus must have been 8/0.02 = 400, which means the government is seriously under-reporting the number of positive cases (remember we are assuming the number of deaths can be trusted, but not the number of positive cases reported!). Are those users right to assume the government is under-reporting the number? If yes, do we expect the number of positive cases to be around 400? Let's find out!

The solution is actually very simple. We are going to use a contingency table to talk about this case. Let's define two events *A* and *B*, to represent *death* and having contracted the corona virus, respectively. This means, *P*(*A* ∣ *B*) is equal to 2% and is the probability that a person dies **given** that they had the contracted the virus. Let's consider the following contingency table (to learn more about contingency tables see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table)).

Assume each value inside of the table is the number associated with the corresponding event. For example, *s* is the number of people, who contracted the virus **and** died, and we know *s* = 8. The other piece of information we have is the mortality rate caused by the virus, which is *P*(*A* ∣ *B*)=0.02. We are interested in finding the number of people who have contracted the virus in this scenario, or the *u*. Note that the above probability can be re-written as $P(A \mid B)=\frac{s}{s+u}=0.02$. Knowing *s* = 8, we calculate *u* = 92.

#### The Conclusion

Yes, the government is probably being secretive about the total number of people who have tested positive for the virus (assuming the death numbers is to be trusted), as 43 is far smaller than 92 and this could not have happened by chance (or could it?). However, the actual number of patients who must have tested positive must be far less than what the users in the comment section of that post were projecting!
